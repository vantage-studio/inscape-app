The Oerplint will become a timeless monumental element that forms the podium for the other building blocks, bookended by the Kopblok and Tramloods, a museum for historical trams with cultural programming atop called De Vrijplaats. We drew inspiration from the site’s original railway character, radiating abundance and timeless appeal. Functionally, the plinth recalls the activity of the Havenstraatterrein’s second life, housing flexible studios, affordable maker spaces, restaurants, and cultural venues.</p>

To provide energy to all the buildings in the area, a substation is required to convert higher voltage into lower voltage electricity that can be distributed to the various neighborhoods. In terms of sustainable ambitions, the island is far ahead, and the expectations were high. As the first building on Strandeiland, our substation plays a crucial role in the area’s sustainable development, setting an example for the ambitious growth of Amsterdam’s urban landscape. Opting for sustainability, we chose a clear design using durable, aesthetically pleasing orange stone for the brick façade. Collaborating with StoneCycling, known for their commitment to reusable materials, our project used a combination of whole bricks, protruding heads, and brick strips for ventilation. Together, we upcycled 121,920 kg of waste.

To provide energy to all the buildings in the area, a substation is required to convert higher voltage into lower voltage electricity that can be distributed to the various neighborhoods. In terms of sustainable ambitions, the island is far ahead, and the expectations were high. As the first building on Strandeiland, our substation plays a crucial role in the area’s sustainable development, setting an example for the ambitious growth of Amsterdam’s urban landscape. Opting for sustainability, we chose a clear design using durable, aesthetically pleasing orange stone for the brick façade. Collaborating with StoneCycling, known for their commitment to reusable materials, our project used a combination of whole bricks, protruding heads, and brick strips for ventilation. Together, we upcycled 121,920 kg of waste.

It’s a one-off in the Netherlands to have such a tall tower in a city center. Nevertheless, Baan Tower does not rely on height alone for its impact, but on architectural quality. The design can be described as quite rational, on a straightforward square plan, but unique in our use of rich materials and huge windows. Measuring 2.3m x 2.3m, these windows allow amazing, unobstructed views of the cityscape, underlining the special nature of the location, which we characterize as “golden”. In the heart of the city, it’s a short stroll to the lively Witte de Withstraat, several schools, and many other facilities.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The choice of dramatic black marble for the façade is daring, yet elegant. The dark façade and the anodized window frames give the building a unique architectural character in Rotterdam – whereas other nearby towers are light-colored. We added detailing in travertine to link to the post-war heritage of Rotterdam. Embedding a building in the local surroundings is typical of our Powerhouse Company approach: we always visit and re-visit the site extensively during the design process. The power of the context is something we want to harness.\u003c/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"media","type":"full","media":{"media_type":"image","media_ratio":"100","ratio":[],"video":"","allow_fullscreen_video":false,"fullscreen_video":"","image":{"ID":3893,"id":3893,"title":"C09","filename":"C09.jpg","filesize":711197,"url":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150810/C09.jpg","link":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/story/contemporary-classic/c09/","alt":"","author":"8","description":"","caption":"","name":"c09","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":3889,"date":"2022-02-28 15:08:10","modified":"2022-02-28 15:08:10","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":827,"height":634,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150810/C09-150x150.jpg","thumbnail-width":150,"thumbnail-height":150,"medium":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150810/C09-300x230.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":230,"medium_large":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150810/C09-768x589.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":589,"large":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150810/C09.jpg","large-width":827,"large-height":634,"1536x1536":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150810/C09.jpg","1536x1536-width":827,"1536x1536-height":634,"2048x2048":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150810/C09.jpg","2048x2048-width":827,"2048x2048-height":634,"xlarge":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150810/C09.jpg","xlarge-width":827,"xlarge-height":634}},"caption":""}},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"\u003cp>\u003cstrong>&#8216;Art Deco Atmosphere&#8217;\u003cbr />\nStefan Prins, Partner at Powerhouse Company\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The building’s plinth plays an important role in connecting Baan Tower to the urban fabric. The entrance lobby is welcoming, transparent and open. It adds energy to the new neighborhood. A rundown area until recently, the up-and-coming Baan quarter is now one of hottest locations in the city. The lobby is minimalist in style yet enriched by the tactility of the black marble. Champagne anodized window frames add a sumptuous touch. Inside, but visible from the street, a ceiling painting in gold depicts the so-called “Dutch mountains” – the big cloudy skies for which the Netherlands is known. The use of marble, and a touch of Art Deco atmosphere, recall other buildings we designed, including the monumental Villa B in Germany and Merckt in Groningen, the Netherlands. Baan Tower taps into the theme of contemporary classicism in our work. It’s modern, yet also timeless. You see lots of towers, but few are materialized in stone. This makes Baan Tower an enduring landmark, a worthy addition to the great modern architectural heritage of Rotterdam.\u003c/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"media","type":"inline","media":{"media_type":"image","media_ratio":"100","ratio":[],"video":"","allow_fullscreen_video":false,"fullscreen_video":"","image":{"ID":3894,"id":3894,"title":"C27-c02","filename":"C27-c02.jpg","filesize":338291,"url":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150811/C27-c02.jpg","link":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/story/contemporary-classic/c27-c02/","alt":"","author":"8","description":"","caption":"","name":"c27-c02","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":3889,"date":"2022-02-28 15:08:11","modified":"2022-02-28 15:08:11","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":468,"height":429,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150811/C27-c02-150x150.jpg","thumbnail-width":150,"thumbnail-height":150,"medium":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150811/C27-c02-300x275.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":275,"medium_large":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150811/C27-c02.jpg","medium_large-width":468,"medium_large-height":429,"large":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150811/C27-c02.jpg","large-width":468,"large-height":429,"1536x1536":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150811/C27-c02.jpg","1536x1536-width":468,"1536x1536-height":429,"2048x2048":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150811/C27-c02.jpg","2048x2048-width":468,"2048x2048-height":429,"xlarge":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150811/C27-c02.jpg","xlarge-width":468,"xlarge-height":429}},"caption":""}},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"\u003cp>\u003cstrong>&#8216;Accessible Luxury&#8217;\u003cbr />\nNanne de Ru, Founder at Powerhouse Company\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Despite its rather opulent appearance, Baan Tower is more accessible than exclusive. It’s a special residential project as all the homes are rentals – which is unique in this area. This means that the homes are within the reach of a wide demographic, and the different types of apartments also reflect this. The 427 homes in the tower will range from one-person studios to family-sized four-bedroom apartments. In addition, an unusual range of services will add a community feel. Residents will be able to use the communal pool and roof park. They can also book a workspace in The Library, or a guest apartment for visitors, or reserve the Living Room for a party – via either the concierge or the Baan Tower app. There’s also a strong focus on health, with indoor parking spaces for 1000 bicycles and a gym as well as the pool and park. In designing Baan Tower, we were inspired by two other towers: Wim Quist’s dark, sleek Robeco Tower (now Allianz Tower) in Rotterdam, and Raphael Vinoly’s 432 Park Avenue in New York, with its large square windows. Of course, we also drew on our own wide-ranging villa portfolio, and its long experience of residential architecture. We love to design wonderful homes for people to live in. There is nothing standard about Baan Tower. We’ve designed an apartment building that we would like to live in ourselves.\u003c/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"media","type":"full","media":{"media_type":"image","media_ratio":"100","ratio":[],"video":"","allow_fullscreen_video":false,"fullscreen_video":"","image":{"ID":3890,"id":3890,"title":"4938_BaanTower_Pool_v10_FINAL_HR-1","filename":"4938_BaanTower_Pool_v10_FINAL_HR-1.jpg","filesize":502362,"url":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150808/4938_BaanTower_Pool_v10_FINAL_HR-1.jpg","link":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/story/contemporary-classic/4938_baantower_pool_v10_final_hr-1/","alt":"","author":"8","description":"","caption":"","name":"4938_baantower_pool_v10_final_hr-1","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":3889,"date":"2022-02-28

It’s a one-off in the Netherlands to have such a tall tower in a city center. Nevertheless, Baan Tower does not rely on height alone for its impact, but on architectural quality. The design can be described as quite rational, on a straightforward square plan, but unique in our use of rich materials and huge windows. Measuring 2.3m x 2.3m, these windows allow amazing, unobstructed views of the cityscape, underlining the special nature of the location, which we characterize as “golden”. In the heart of the city, it’s a short stroll to the lively Witte de Withstraat, several schools, and many other facilities.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The choice of dramatic black marble for the façade is daring, yet elegant. The dark façade and the anodized window frames give the building a unique architectural character in Rotterdam – whereas other nearby towers are light-colored. We added detailing in travertine to link to the post-war heritage of Rotterdam. Embedding a building in the local surroundings is typical of our Powerhouse Company approach: we always visit and re-visit the site extensively during the design process. The power of the context is something we want to harness.\u003c/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"media","type":"full","media":{"media_type":"image","media_ratio":"100","ratio":[],"video":"","allow_fullscreen_video":false,"fullscreen_video":"","image":{"ID":3893,"id":3893,"title":"C09","filename":"C09.jpg","filesize":711197,"url":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150810/C09.jpg","link":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/story/contemporary-classic/c09/","alt":"","author":"8","description":"","caption":"","name":"c09","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":3889,"date":"2022-02-28 15:08:10","modified":"2022-02-28 15:08:10","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":827,"height":634,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150810/C09-150x150.jpg","thumbnail-width":150,"thumbnail-height":150,"medium":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150810/C09-300x230.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":230,"medium_large":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150810/C09-768x589.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":589,"large":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150810/C09.jpg","large-width":827,"large-height":634,"1536x1536":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150810/C09.jpg","1536x1536-width":827,"1536x1536-height":634,"2048x2048":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150810/C09.jpg","2048x2048-width":827,"2048x2048-height":634,"xlarge":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150810/C09.jpg","xlarge-width":827,"xlarge-height":634}},"caption":""}},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"\u003cp>\u003cstrong>&#8216;Art Deco Atmosphere&#8217;\u003cbr />\nStefan Prins, Partner at Powerhouse Company\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The building’s plinth plays an important role in connecting Baan Tower to the urban fabric. The entrance lobby is welcoming, transparent and open. It adds energy to the new neighborhood. A rundown area until recently, the up-and-coming Baan quarter is now one of hottest locations in the city. The lobby is minimalist in style yet enriched by the tactility of the black marble. Champagne anodized window frames add a sumptuous touch. Inside, but visible from the street, a ceiling painting in gold depicts the so-called “Dutch mountains” – the big cloudy skies for which the Netherlands is known. The use of marble, and a touch of Art Deco atmosphere, recall other buildings we designed, including the monumental Villa B in Germany and Merckt in Groningen, the Netherlands. Baan Tower taps into the theme of contemporary classicism in our work. It’s modern, yet also timeless. You see lots of towers, but few are materialized in stone. This makes Baan Tower an enduring landmark, a worthy addition to the great modern architectural heritage of Rotterdam.\u003c/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"media","type":"inline","media":{"media_type":"image","media_ratio":"100","ratio":[],"video":"","allow_fullscreen_video":false,"fullscreen_video":"","image":{"ID":3894,"id":3894,"title":"C27-c02","filename":"C27-c02.jpg","filesize":338291,"url":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150811/C27-c02.jpg","link":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/story/contemporary-classic/c27-c02/","alt":"","author":"8","description":"","caption":"","name":"c27-c02","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":3889,"date":"2022-02-28 15:08:11","modified":"2022-02-28 15:08:11","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":468,"height":429,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150811/C27-c02-150x150.jpg","thumbnail-width":150,"thumbnail-height":150,"medium":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150811/C27-c02-300x275.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":275,"medium_large":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150811/C27-c02.jpg","medium_large-width":468,"medium_large-height":429,"large":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150811/C27-c02.jpg","large-width":468,"large-height":429,"1536x1536":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150811/C27-c02.jpg","1536x1536-width":468,"1536x1536-height":429,"2048x2048":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150811/C27-c02.jpg","2048x2048-width":468,"2048x2048-height":429,"xlarge":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150811/C27-c02.jpg","xlarge-width":468,"xlarge-height":429}},"caption":""}},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"\u003cp>\u003cstrong>&#8216;Accessible Luxury&#8217;\u003cbr />\nNanne de Ru, Founder at Powerhouse Company\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Despite its rather opulent appearance, Baan Tower is more accessible than exclusive. It’s a special residential project as all the homes are rentals – which is unique in this area. This means that the homes are within the reach of a wide demographic, and the different types of apartments also reflect this. The 427 homes in the tower will range from one-person studios to family-sized four-bedroom apartments. In addition, an unusual range of services will add a community feel. Residents will be able to use the communal pool and roof park. They can also book a workspace in The Library, or a guest apartment for visitors, or reserve the Living Room for a party – via either the concierge or the Baan Tower app. There’s also a strong focus on health, with indoor parking spaces for 1000 bicycles and a gym as well as the pool and park. In designing Baan Tower, we were inspired by two other towers: Wim Quist’s dark, sleek Robeco Tower (now Allianz Tower) in Rotterdam, and Raphael Vinoly’s 432 Park Avenue in New York, with its large square windows. Of course, we also drew on our own wide-ranging villa portfolio, and its long experience of residential architecture. We love to design wonderful homes for people to live in. There is nothing standard about Baan Tower. We’ve designed an apartment building that we would like to live in ourselves.\u003c/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"media","type":"full","media":{"media_type":"image","media_ratio":"100","ratio":[],"video":"","allow_fullscreen_video":false,"fullscreen_video":"","image":{"ID":3890,"id":3890,"title":"4938_BaanTower_Pool_v10_FINAL_HR-1","filename":"4938_BaanTower_Pool_v10_FINAL_HR-1.jpg","filesize":502362,"url":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150808/4938_BaanTower_Pool_v10_FINAL_HR-1.jpg","link":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/story/contemporary-classic/4938_baantower_pool_v10_final_hr-1/","alt":"","author":"8","description":"","caption":"","name":"4938_baantower_pool_v10_final_hr-1","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":3889,"date":"2022-02-28 15:08:08","modified":"2022-02-28 15:08:08","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":802,"height":601,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150808/4938_BaanTower_Pool_v10_FINAL_HR-1-150x150.jpg","thumbnail-width":150,"thumbnail-height":150,"medium":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150808/4938_BaanTower_Pool_v10_FINAL_HR-1-300x225.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":225,"medium_large":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150808/4938_BaanTower_Pool_v10_FINAL_HR-1-768x576.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":576,"large":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150808/4938_BaanTower_Pool_v10_FINAL_HR-1.jpg","large-width":802,"large-height":601,"1536x1536":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150808/4938_BaanTower_Pool_v10_FINAL_HR-1.jpg","1536x1536-width":802,"1536x1536-height":601,"2048x2048":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150808/4938_BaanTower_Pool_v10_FINAL_HR-1.jpg","2048x2048-width":802,"2048x2048-height":601,"xlarge":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/28150808/4938_BaanTower_Pool_v10_FINAL_HR-1.jpg","xlarge-width":802,"xlarge-height":601}},"caption":""}}]},"next_post":{"id":3557,"date":"2021-08-19T09:27:05","date_gmt":"2021-08-19T09:27:05","guid":{"rendered":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/?post_type=stories&#038;p=3557"},"modified":"2022-04-22T10:09:59","modified_gmt":"2022-04-22T10:09:59","slug":"university-building-of-the-future","status":"publish","type":"stories","link":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/story/university-building-of-the-future/","title":{"rendered":"University Building of the Future"},"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","case_type":[],"yoast_head":"\u003c!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.9 -

While educational buildings are usually highly specialized – with specific characteristics that don&#8217;t easily lend themselves to change – our design for the university is rooted in its ability to adapt to future needs. In its current configuration, each department is housed on its own floor, with a showcase terrace facing the public atrium.

This sense of uncertainty is inherent within the rationale of the building, that has been future proofed throughout. Both the high-rise and low-rise buildings are highly efficient structures that can be subdivided in many ways to adapt to changing educational needs. But we took our thinking further: what if its function changes? We consciously split the installations of each building, meaning the atrium roof can easily be removed, leaving two separate buildings. Every non load-bearing structure, such as the terrace floors, can be disassembled. Its facade can be removed, leaving its concrete hull to be reconfigured. The Jakoba Mulderhuis not only is adaptable to the short term needs of changing education, but it also holds the potential to drastically change its function. What if, in a hundred years, the university needs to make way for housing, for example? Its ability to change is an imperative with its location in Amsterdam&#8217;s city center, ensuring a long-lasting life of use.\u003c/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"media","type":"full","media":{"media_type":"image","media_ratio":"100","ratio":[],"video":"","allow_fullscreen_video":false,"fullscreen_video":"","image":{"ID":3584,"id":3584,"title":"Building-of-the-Future-04","filename":"Building-of-the-Future-04.jpg","filesize":263791,"url":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19090735/Building-of-the-Future-04.jpg","link":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/story/university-building-of-the-future/building-of-the-future-04/","alt":"","author":"8","description":"","caption":"","name":"building-of-the-future-04","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":3557,"date":"2021-08-19 09:07:34","modified":"2021-08-19 09:24:40","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":1242,"height":768,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19090735/Building-of-the-Future-04-150x150.jpg","thumbnail-width":150,"thumbnail-height":150,"medium":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19090735/Building-of-the-Future-04-300x186.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":186,"medium_large":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19090735/Building-of-the-Future-04-768x475.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":475,"large":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19090735/Building-of-the-Future-04-1024x633.jpg","large-width":1024,"large-height":633,"1536x1536":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19090735/Building-of-the-Future-04.jpg","1536x1536-width":1242,"1536x1536-height":768,"2048x2048":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19090735/Building-of-the-Future-04.jpg","2048x2048-width":1242,"2048x2048-height":768,"xlarge":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19090735/Building-of-the-Future-04.jpg","xlarge-width":1242,"xlarge-height":768}},"caption":""}},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"\u003cp>\u003cstrong>&#8216;Inspiration through interaction&#8217;\u003cbr />\nMarc Koehler, Founder of Marc Koehler Architects\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>When you meet someone for the first time in a maths class at university, the idea that 20 years later you&#8217;ll be designing AUAS&#8217;s new building together isn&#8217;t exactly the first thing that springs to mind! In our student days, Nanne de Ru (Powerhouse) and I always liked to push the boundaries. This was perfectly exemplified by our work on AUAS&#8217;s design together with de Architekten Cie, as we submitted a design that wasn&#8217;t quite what AUAS had asked for. It was a risky proposition, but we knew everything would work out for the best. In AUAS&#8217;s original plan, the Jakoba Mulderhuis would be a single building separated from the Theo Thijssen building by a passageway. In our design, we split the building up into a high-rise wing and a low-rise wing, removed the passageway and designed an atrium to connect the Jakoba Mulderhuis with the Theo Thijssen building. It was a bold move to change the original design so much, and maybe even a bit cheeky too!\u003c/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"media","type":"inline","media":{"media_type":"image","media_ratio":"100","ratio":[],"video":"","allow_fullscreen_video":false,"fullscreen_video":"","image":{"ID":3585,"id":3585,"title":"Building-of-the-Future-05","filename":"Building-of-the-Future-05.jpg","filesize":70525,"url":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19090735/Building-of-the-Future-05.jpg","link":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/story/university-building-of-the-future/building-of-the-future-05/","alt":"","author":"8","description":"","caption":"","name":"building-of-the-future-05","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":3557,"date":"2021-08-19 09:07:35","modified":"2021-08-19 09:24:40","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":695,"height":559,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19090735/Building-of-the-Future-05-150x150.jpg","thumbnail-width":150,"thumbnail-height":150,"medium":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19090735/Building-of-the-Future-05-300x241.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":241,"medium_large":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19090735/Building-of-the-Future-05.jpg","medium_large-width":695,"medium_large-height":559,"large":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19090735/Building-of-the-Future-05.jpg","large-width":695,"large-height":559,"1536x1536":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19090735/Building-of-the-Future-05.jpg","1536x1536-width":695,"1536x1536-height":559,"2048x2048":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19090735/Building-of-the-Future-05.jpg","2048x2048-width":695,"2048x2048-height":559,"xlarge":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19090735/Building-of-the-Future-05.jpg","xlarge-width":695,"xlarge-height":559}},"caption":""}},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"\u003cp>As students at AUAS, we always felt at home in the building and in our own rented studio. You could work till late on projects if you were really feeling inspired and you wouldn&#8217;t simply be kicked out at 5 o&#8217;clock. This kind of atmosphere inspires creativity and people love to be in a creative environment: this is where brilliant ideas are born. I want the building to be a place where students, lecturers and experts from all faculties come together, share ideas, interact and inspire each other. The atrium&#8217;s terrace layout means students &#8216;hop&#8217; from floor to floor and draw inspiration from the projects that they pass along the way. The Jakoba Mulderhuis is all about inspiring cross-pollination of ideas in an open and creative environment.&#8221;\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>&#8216;Breaking down educational barriers&#8217;\u003cbr />\nGerard Kuiper, Director of Education at the Faculty of Technology\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Since 2012, we have been working hard here to develop a city campus in which a diverse range of faculties come together. The tender for the design of the Conrad Building was actually based on the &#8216;traditional&#8217; structure of the Faculty of Technology. The team of de Architekten Cie, MKA and Powerhouse developed a bold design with an atrium that connects the two buildings: a semi-public space into which all of the building&#8217;s floors extend. This open and transparent ambience really captured our imagination, and we are going to further develop this design into a future-proof draft. The building ties in perfectly with our new vision of education and research: more project-based work and fewer lectures, with students working together as communities. This new vision requires a new learning environment, and we&#8217;ll have to develop new routines. It will take some getting used to. Soon, students and lecturers will work in themed community areas across the high-rise and low-rise wings in which students from other programmes will also be working. This sort of cross-pollination will be essential to solving the wider social themes of the future. We develop knowledge and provide facilities for experts via studios that offer all necessary equipment, methodologies, knowledge and expertise. These nine studios, which focus on areas such as sensor technology, BIM, virtual reality and the energy transition, are spread throughout the building. I&#8217;m really looking forward to it. The faculty&#8217;s dynamism will now be visible to all in the building and tangible to its users. In our heads, we&#8217;ve already moved away from traditional structures and boundaries and the new building perfectly expresses this new vision in concrete form. We are hugely driven to bring together the various disciplines and stimulate substantial collaborations. The building will play a vital role in facilitating these ambitions and may well be key to the further development of education at AUAS.\u003c/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"media","type":"inline","media":{"media_type":"image","media_ratio":"100","ratio":[],"video":"","allow_fullscreen_video":false,"fullscreen_video":"","image":{"ID":3591,"id":3591,"title":"Building-of-the-Future-08","filename":"Building-of-the-Future-08.jpg","filesize":105931,"url":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19125142/Building-of-the-Future-08.jpg","link":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/story/university-building-of-the-future/building-of-the-future-08/","alt":"","author":"8","description":"","caption":"","name":"building-of-the-future-08","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":3557,"date":"2021-08-19 12:51:42","modified":"2021-08-19 12:51:42","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":718,"height":579,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19125142/Building-of-the-Future-08-150x150.jpg","thumbnail-width":150,"thumbnail-height":150,"medium":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19125142/Building-of-the-Future-08-300x242.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":242,"medium_large":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19125142/Building-of-the-Future-08.jpg","medium_large-width":718,"medium_large-height":579,"large":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19125142/Building-of-the-Future-08.jpg","large-width":718,"large-height":579,"1536x1536":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19125142/Building-of-the-Future-08.jpg","1536x1536-width":718,"1536x1536-height":579,"2048x2048":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19125142/Building-of-the-Future-08.jpg","2048x2048-width":718,"2048x2048-height":579,"xlarge":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19125142/Building-of-the-Future-08.jpg","xlarge-width":718,"xlarge-height":579}},"caption":""}},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"\u003cp>\u003cstrong>&#8216;Flexible property is the future&#8217;\u003cbr />\nHans Wichers Schreur, Director of Campus Real Estate and Policy at AUAS\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Conrad Building is part of AUAS&#8217;s real estate road map and the crowning jewel of the Amstel Campus when it comes to AUAS’s real estate.

The restrictions due to Covid have ushered in mass use of online learning – indeed, transforming our use of educational buildings even further. How will we use our education buildings of the future? Will they be used only for meetings? Will they still be our main space for collaboration? And how can architecture respond to these unknowns? While educational buildings are usually highly specialized – with specific characteristics that don&#8217;t easily lend themselves to change – our design for the university is rooted in its ability to adapt to future needs. In its current configuration, each department is housed on its own floor, with a showcase terrace facing the public atrium.

This sense of uncertainty is inherent within the rationale of the building, that has been future proofed throughout. Both the high-rise and low-rise buildings are highly efficient structures that can be subdivided in many ways to adapt to changing educational needs. But we took our thinking further: what if its function changes? We consciously split the installations of each building, meaning the atrium roof can easily be removed, leaving two separate buildings. Every non load-bearing structure, such as the terrace floors, can be disassembled. Its facade can be removed, leaving its concrete hull to be reconfigured. The Jakoba Mulderhuis not only is adaptable to the short term needs of changing education, but it also holds the potential to drastically change its function. What if, in a hundred years, the university needs to make way for housing, for example?

In our student days, Nanne de Ru (Powerhouse) and I always liked to push the boundaries. This was perfectly exemplified by our work on AUAS&#8217;s design together with de Architekten Cie, as we submitted a design that wasn&#8217;t quite what AUAS had asked for. It was a risky proposition, but we knew everything would work out for the best. In AUAS&#8217;s original plan, the Jakoba Mulderhuis would be a single building separated from the Theo Thijssen building by a passageway. In our design, we split the building up into a high-rise wing and a low-rise wing, removed the passageway and designed an atrium to connect the Jakoba Mulderhuis with the Theo Thijssen building. It was a bold move to change the original design so much, and maybe even a bit cheeky too!\u003c/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"media","type":"inline","media":{"media_type":"image","media_ratio":"100","ratio":[],"video":"","allow_fullscreen_video":false,"fullscreen_video":"","image":{"ID":3585,"id":3585,"title":"Building-of-the-Future-05","filename":"Building-of-the-Future-05.jpg","filesize":70525,"url":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19090735/Building-of-the-Future-05.jpg","link":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/story/university-building-of-the-future/building-of-the-future-05/","alt":"","author":"8","description":"","caption":"","name":"building-of-the-future-05","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":3557,"date":"2021-08-19 09:07:35","modified":"2021-08-19 09:24:40","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":695,"height":559,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19090735/Building-of-the-Future-05-150x150.jpg","thumbnail-width":150,"thumbnail-height":150,"medium":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19090735/Building-of-the-Future-05-300x241.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":241,"medium_large":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19090735/Building-of-the-Future-05.jpg","medium_large-width":695,"medium_large-height":559,"large":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19090735/Building-of-the-Future-05.jpg","large-width":695,"large-height":559,"1536x1536":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19090735/Building-of-the-Future-05.jpg","1536x1536-width":695,"1536x1536-height":559,"2048x2048":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19090735/Building-of-the-Future-05.jpg","2048x2048-width":695,"2048x2048-height":559,"xlarge":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19090735/Building-of-the-Future-05.jpg","xlarge-width":695,"xlarge-height":559}},"caption":""}},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"\u003cp>As students at AUAS, we always felt at home in the building and in our own rented studio.

This kind of atmosphere inspires creativity and people love to be in a creative environment: this is where brilliant ideas are born. I want the building to be a place where students, lecturers and experts from all faculties come together, share ideas, interact and inspire each other.

The tender for the design of the Conrad Building was actually based on the &#8216;traditional&#8217; structure of the Faculty of Technology. The team of de Architekten Cie, MKA and Powerhouse developed a bold design with an atrium that connects the two buildings: a semi-public space into which all of the building&#8217;s floors extend. This open and transparent ambience really captured our imagination, and we are going to further develop this design into a future-proof draft. The building ties in perfectly with our new vision of education and research: more project-based work and fewer lectures, with students working together as communities. This new vision requires a new learning environment, and we&#8217;ll have to develop new routines. It will take some getting used to. Soon, students and lecturers will work in themed community areas across the high-rise and low-rise wings in which students from other programmes will also be working. This sort of cross-pollination will be essential to solving the wider social themes of the future. We develop knowledge and provide facilities for experts via studios that offer all necessary equipment, methodologies, knowledge and expertise. These nine studios, which focus on areas such as sensor technology, BIM, virtual reality and the energy transition, are spread throughout the building. I&#8217;m really looking forward to it. The faculty&#8217;s dynamism will now be visible to all in the building and tangible to its users. In our heads, we&#8217;ve already moved away from traditional structures and boundaries and the new building perfectly expresses this new vision in concrete form. We are hugely driven to bring together the various disciplines and stimulate substantial collaborations. The building will play a vital role in facilitating these ambitions and may well be key to the further development of education at AUAS.\u003c/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"media","type":"inline","media":{"media_type":"image","media_ratio":"100","ratio":[],"video":"","allow_fullscreen_video":false,"fullscreen_video":"","image":{"ID":3591,"id":3591,"title":"Building-of-the-Future-08","filename":"Building-of-the-Future-08.jpg","filesize":105931,"url":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19125142/Building-of-the-Future-08.jpg","link":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/story/university-building-of-the-future/building-of-the-future-08/","alt":"","author":"8","description":"","caption":"","name":"building-of-the-future-08","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":3557,"date":"2021-08-19 12:51:42","modified":"2021-08-19 12:51:42","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":718,"height":579,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19125142/Building-of-the-Future-08-150x150.jpg","thumbnail-width":150,"thumbnail-height":150,"medium":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19125142/Building-of-the-Future-08-300x242.jpg","medium-width":300,"medium-height":242,"medium_large":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19125142/Building-of-the-Future-08.jpg","medium_large-width":718,"medium_large-height":579,"large":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19125142/Building-of-the-Future-08.jpg","large-width":718,"large-height":579,"1536x1536":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19125142/Building-of-the-Future-08.jpg","1536x1536-width":718,"1536x1536-height":579,"2048x2048":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19125142/Building-of-the-Future-08.jpg","2048x2048-width":718,"2048x2048-height":579,"xlarge":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/19125142/Building-of-the-Future-08.jpg","xlarge-width":718,"xlarge-height":579}},"caption":""}},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"\u003cp>\u003cstrong>&#8216;Flexible property is the future&#8217;\u003cbr />\nHans Wichers Schreur, Director of Campus Real Estate and Policy at AUAS\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Conrad Building is part of AUAS&#8217;s real estate road map and the crowning jewel of the Amstel Campus when it comes to AUAS’s real estate.

One of the challenges was – as it usually is in educational buildings – how to keep down the noise between classrooms and lecture halls. Initially, this paradox seemed impossible to solve, because wood loves to vibrate. In order to stop sound from vibrating to adjacent rooms, walls needed to be decoupled. We essentially needed to engineer a box in a box.

One of the challenges was – as it usually is in educational buildings – how to keep down the noise between classrooms and lecture halls. Initially, this paradox seemed impossible to solve, because wood loves to vibrate. In order to stop sound from vibrating to adjacent rooms, walls needed to be decoupled. We essentially needed to engineer a box in a box. To solve this complicated conundrum, we used BIM to detail and implement all the prerequisites at a very high level.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>The Tilburg lecture hall hides its wooden structure behind a limestone façade, appearing like another timeless design on the University Campus.

This way we could easily decide to create more concrete floors from below, if the budget required it.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>By embracing the flexibility of this hybrid design, we could work closely with the client and make adjustments in later stages of the projects – a great advantage in meeting the changing needs of other stakeholders too.\u003c/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"media","type":"inline","media":{"media_type":"image","media_ratio":"100","ratio":[],"video":"","allow_fullscreen_video":false,"fullscreen_video":"","image":{"ID":3310,"id":3310,"title":"Powerhouse-Company-FOR-Sebastian-van-Damme-still-02","filename":"Powerhouse-Company-FOR-Sebastian-van-Damme-still-02.jpg","filesize":805338,"url":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21110630/Powerhouse-Company-FOR-Sebastian-van-Damme-still-02.jpg","link":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/story/lessons-in-living-learning-and-working-in-wood/powerhouse-company-for-sebastian-van-damme-still-02/","alt":"","author":"8","description":"","caption":"","name":"powerhouse-company-for-sebastian-van-damme-still-02","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":3290,"date":"2021-01-21 11:06:26","modified":"2021-01-21 11:06:26","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":2667,"height":4000,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21110630/Powerhouse-Company-FOR-Sebastian-van-Damme-still-02-150x150.jpg","thumbnail-width":150,"thumbnail-height":150,"medium":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21110630/Powerhouse-Company-FOR-Sebastian-van-Damme-still-02-200x300.jpg","medium-width":200,"medium-height":300,"medium_large":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21110630/Powerhouse-Company-FOR-Sebastian-van-Damme-still-02-768x1152.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":1152,"large":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21110630/Powerhouse-Company-FOR-Sebastian-van-Damme-still-02-683x1024.jpg","large-width":683,"large-height":1024,"1536x1536":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21110630/Powerhouse-Company-FOR-Sebastian-van-Damme-still-02.jpg","1536x1536-width":1024,"1536x1536-height":1536,"2048x2048":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21110630/Powerhouse-Company-FOR-Sebastian-van-Damme-still-02.jpg","2048x2048-width":1366,"2048x2048-height":2048,"xlarge":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/21110630/Powerhouse-Company-FOR-Sebastian-van-Damme-still-02-933x1400.jpg","xlarge-width":933,"xlarge-height":1400}},"caption":"Installation of the cross-laminated timber floors at Floating Office Rotterdam "}},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Timber is ideal for reusable structures\u003c/strong>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Our Floating Office Rotterdam (FOR) embodies contemporary sustainable tech and demonstrates the potential of timber in the circular economy.

I still remember it vividly: Thursday nights, I’d usually ride my bike from university after working late into the evening on project work. I’d be greeted by the peculiar smell of the wooden floor stained with beer and cigarettes. I always liked the building, even though other people sometimes said it was ugly. Brutal, even. But wasn’t that the point? The Bunker is a Brutalist building. Designed by Hugh Maaskant at the end of his career, when he had let go of the more rigid rules of Modernism in favor of an architecture that offers a certain kind of grandeur and monumentality, but also liveliness and a human scale.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I have always admired Maaskant’s buildings, both Modernist and Brutalist. He was, of course, one of the Netherlands’ most famous and prolific architects, leaving a legacy that embodies the optimism of the postwar period. Industrial structures like the Tomado Factory and corporate headquarters like Johnson Wax; landmarks like the Euromast and cosmopolitan hotels like the Rotterdam Hilton; public buildings like the Provinciehuis Brabant and the Technikon educational complex: They are all bold architectural statements, the architecture of progress.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Then, in 1969, came the monolithic, multi-use building for the student union, social clubs and cafeteria of the new Technical University Eindhoven: the Student Centre, which was nicknamed ‘De Bunker’ almost as soon as it was completed. This building became a focal point in the lives of almost all Eindhoven students, myself included.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In my first year at university, the Bunker was where the party was. You went there for drinks with friends, perhaps a bite to eat, and the possibility of hanging around long enough for late-night fun. Apart from the introductory week, the bigger and taller spaces at end of the building were reserved for the student societies. But there was a shared bar for everyone, a nice long space with a balcony over its full length.

It soon became clear that, if we wanted to save the existing building, the last thing we needed was to have it listed – which is ironic, to say the least. There was a lot of arguing and discussion involved while we explained our vision for reworking the building.

What I like about Brutalism comes down partly to a certain nostalgia for postwar optimism: You really see that people wanted to embrace the future, and Brutalism was one of the ways they did that. This is beautifully illustrated in several examples in London, like the Southbank Centre and the Barbican.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>My tips for restoring Brutalist buildings? On a practical level, I would say clean up the concrete – and keep it clean. The rough materials usual in Brutalist buildings need extra attention to keep them looking good. Spatially, it’s always tempting to add some extra facade openings to increase their transparency – because, while Brutalist buildings can be quite transparent in a paradoxical kind of way, they don&#8217;t always appear so in their extreme concrete expression!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>These were among the considerations that we applied to Maaskant’s Eindhoven monument, with great success.

I still remember it vividly: Thursday nights, I’d usually ride my bike from university after working late into the evening on project work. I’d be greeted by the peculiar smell of the wooden floor stained with beer and cigarettes. I always liked the building, even though other people sometimes said it was ugly. Brutal, even. But wasn’t that the point? The Bunker is a Brutalist building. Designed by Hugh Maaskant at the end of his career, when he had let go of the more rigid rules of Modernism in favor of an architecture that offers a certain kind of grandeur and monumentality, but also liveliness and a human scale.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>I have always admired Maaskant’s buildings, both Modernist and Brutalist. He was, of course, one of the Netherlands’ most famous and prolific architects, leaving a legacy that embodies the optimism of the postwar period. Industrial structures like the Tomado Factory and corporate headquarters like Johnson Wax; landmarks like the Euromast and cosmopolitan hotels like the Rotterdam Hilton; public buildings like the Provinciehuis Brabant and the Technikon educational complex: They are all bold architectural statements, the architecture of progress.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Then, in 1969, came the monolithic, multi-use building for the student union, social clubs and cafeteria of the new Technical University Eindhoven: the Student Centre, which was nicknamed ‘De Bunker’ almost as soon as it was completed. This building became a focal point in the lives of almost all Eindhoven students, myself included.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In my first year at university, the Bunker was where the party was. You went there for drinks with friends, perhaps a bite to eat, and the possibility of hanging around long enough for late-night fun. Apart from the introductory week, the bigger and taller spaces at end of the building were reserved for the student societies. But there was a shared bar for everyone, a nice long space with a balcony over its full length.

It soon became clear that, if we wanted to save the existing building, the last thing we needed was to have it listed – which is ironic, to say the least. There was a lot of arguing and discussion involved while we explained our vision for reworking the building.

We analyzed and researched a lot of his buildings, and also the design steps he took in the Bunker, and we projected all of that onto the new tower addition.

What I like about Brutalism comes down partly to a certain nostalgia for postwar optimism: You really see that people wanted to embrace the future, and Brutalism was one of the ways they did that. This is beautifully illustrated in several examples in London, like the Southbank Centre and the Barbican.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>My tips for restoring Brutalist buildings? On a practical level, I would say clean up the concrete – and keep it clean. The rough materials usual in Brutalist buildings need extra attention to keep them looking good. Spatially, it’s always tempting to add some extra facade openings to increase their transparency – because, while Brutalist buildings can be quite transparent in a paradoxical kind of way, they don&#8217;t always appear so in their extreme concrete expression!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>These were among the considerations that we applied to Maaskant’s Eindhoven monument, with great success.

So, how did the two of you meet?\u003c/strong>\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Gilbert:\u003c/strong> I met Nanne in our very first week at university. We found ourselves in the same project group, and we had an immediate connection that deepened during our studies.\u003cbr />\n\u003cstrong>Nanne:\u003c/strong> Yes, we immediately hit it off. Gilbert has a great sense of humor and we also shared the ambition of creating a bigger vision of better buildings.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>\u003cstrong>What led to you working together?\u003c/strong>\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Nanne:\u003c/strong> Our shared passion for integrated design. Gilbert is really driven to integrate design, structure and installations in buildings. That’s quite rare, as many specialists are mainly interested in their own area of expertise. During our education, we worked together on almost all of the design projects, where I would be the ‘architect’ and Gilbert would be the ‘structural engineer’. We worked in groups of eight and Gilbert and I would like to orchestrate the team effort.\u003cbr />\n\u003cstrong>Gilbert:\u003c/strong> One day, a few years after graduation, when we were both working for separate companies, I got a call from Nanne. He was in a ski lift and he had just got the commission for Villa 1. He asked me if I would like to be the structural engineer for this project, so I said, ‘Yes please!’ At first I did Villa 1 alongside my normal job, but soon it became too time consuming. I had to make a choice – give up Villa 1, or give up my job. So I decided to quit my job and start my own structural-engineering firm. I’ve never regretted that decision.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>\u003cstrong>How many projects have you done together?\u003c/strong>\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Nanne:\u003c/strong> So many, I’ve lost count. I think we did almost all the villas together, and many of the public buildings.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>\u003cstrong>Which are you most proud of, and why?\u003c/strong>\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Gilbert:\u003c/strong> Villa 1 is very dear to me. It was our first job, and it was really well executed. It was incredibly intense – and way too time consuming – and the feedback from everybody was overwhelming. Then came Villa L. We took out all the columns and made a cantilever of 32 by 12m. It’s a piece of structural art. There are many more Powerhouse projects of which I am extremely proud, but the next big one for me is Nanne’s apartment. This was as edgy a feat of engineering as edgy can be. It involved balancing everything. It demanded a lot from me, as it was an exceptionally daring project. We pulled it off together.\u003cbr />\n\u003cstrong>Nanne:\u003c/strong> The same ones stand out for me: Villa 1, Villa L and my own house, Penthouse West399. They were intense in terms of design and we really needed the structure to work along with the design. We would spend long hours debating certain solutions and making sure of using only the barest structure. Penthouse West399 was really challenging, since it was so difficult to create a loadbearing glass façade while at the same time making a very light structure that uses only a limited amount of bearing points on top of the roof of the existing structure. I really pushed Gilbert to limit these and I remember vividly that he spent an entire holiday calculating a very thin structure. I didn’t know if it would be possible but simply had a hunch. I think many structural engineers would’ve quit at some point, but Gilbert really persisted and made a beautifully light and nimble structure that’s really amazing!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>\u003cstrong>What do you most appreciate about each other?\u003c/strong>\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Nanne:\u003c/strong> Gilbert is audacious, precise and a realist. He is great to work with as he’s service minded, precise in everything he does, and thinks about practicalities while also ensuring that the design stays at a high level. Since he’s also trained as an architect, next to a degree in structural engineering, he knows what counts in terms of design. And last but not least – he’s a buddy!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Gilbert:\u003c/strong> I love working with Nanne because of his endless enthusiasm. He’s a dreamer with a (sometimes dormant) sense of realism, who is never scared to think (too) big. He’s also very sharing and caring – he’s always trying to let everyone improve themselves and he acts as a coach, sometimes in a really obvious way, but most of the time in a completely natural manner. He has propelled me forward as a person and as a professional. He’s a real friend. I value his opinions and coaching. It’s all about making the cool stuff.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>\u003cstrong>What’s the project you dream of making together?\u003c/strong>\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Gilbert:\u003c/strong> We always said we wanted to build two things together: a skyscraper, and a football stadium. The skyscraper – the Baan Tower – is on the way, so let’s build that stadium!\u003cbr />\n\u003cstrong>Nanne:\u003c/strong> That would be great – even though we support rival teams – Gilbert is an Ajax fan and I’m Feyenoord. I’m pretty sure we would create something epic!\u003c/p>\n"}],"story_author":{"type":"External","team_member":{"ID":492,"post_author":"3","post_date":"2019-07-01 10:21:35","post_date_gmt":"2019-07-01 10:21:35","post_content":"","post_title":"Paul Stavert","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"paul-stavert","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2024-10-03 15:42:22","post_modified_gmt":"2024-10-03 15:42:22","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http://admin.powerhouse.buildin.amsterdam/?post_type=team&#038;p=492","menu_order":1,"post_type":"team","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"name":"Nanne de Ru and Gilbert van der Lee"},"belongs_to_case":[{"ID":2894,"post_author":"3","post_date":"2020-09-11 11:48:10","post_date_gmt":"2020-09-11 11:48:10","post_content":"","post_title":"Behind the Scenes","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"draft","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"behind-the-scenes","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-09-11 11:49:20","post_modified_gmt":"2020-09-11 11:49:20","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/?post_type=cases&#038;p=2894","menu_order":75,"post_type":"cases","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"}]}}},{"id":1119,"date":"2019-10-23T10:12:01","modified":"2020-09-11T11:48:39","slug":"collaboration-is-key","type":"stories","title":{"rendered":"Making the Cool Stuff"},"yoast_head":"\u003c!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.9 -

So, how did the two of you meet?\u003c/strong>\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Gilbert:\u003c/strong> I met Nanne in our very first week at university. We found ourselves in the same project group, and we had an immediate connection that deepened during our studies.\u003cbr />\n\u003cstrong>Nanne:\u003c/strong> Yes, we immediately hit it off. Gilbert has a great sense of humor and we also shared the ambition of creating a bigger vision of better buildings.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>\u003cstrong>What led to you working together?\u003c/strong>\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Nanne:\u003c/strong> Our shared passion for integrated design. Gilbert is really driven to integrate design, structure and installations in buildings. That’s quite rare, as many specialists are mainly interested in their own area of expertise. During our education, we worked together on almost all of the design projects, where I would be the ‘architect’ and Gilbert would be the ‘structural engineer’. We worked in groups of eight and Gilbert and I would like to orchestrate the team effort.\u003cbr />\n\u003cstrong>Gilbert:\u003c/strong> One day, a few years after graduation, when we were both working for separate companies, I got a call from Nanne. He was in a ski lift and he had just got the commission for Villa 1. He asked me if I would like to be the structural engineer for this project, so I said, ‘Yes please!’ At first I did Villa 1 alongside my normal job, but soon it became too time consuming. I had to make a choice – give up Villa 1, or give up my job. So I decided to quit my job and start my own structural-engineering firm. I’ve never regretted that decision.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>\u003cstrong>How many projects have you done together?\u003c/strong>\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Nanne:\u003c/strong> So many, I’ve lost count. I think we did almost all the villas together, and many of the public buildings.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>\u003cstrong>Which are you most proud of, and why?\u003c/strong>\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Gilbert:\u003c/strong> Villa 1 is very dear to me. It was our first job, and it was really well executed. It was incredibly intense – and way too time consuming – and the feedback from everybody was overwhelming. Then came Villa L. We took out all the columns and made a cantilever of 32 by 12m. It’s a piece of structural art. There are many more Powerhouse projects of which I am extremely proud, but the next big one for me is Nanne’s apartment. This was as edgy a feat of engineering as edgy can be. It involved balancing everything. It demanded a lot from me, as it was an exceptionally daring project. We pulled it off together.\u003cbr />\n\u003cstrong>Nanne:\u003c/strong> The same ones stand out for me: Villa 1, Villa L and my own house, Penthouse West399. They were intense in terms of design and we really needed the structure to work along with the design. We would spend long hours debating certain solutions and making sure of using only the barest structure. Penthouse West399 was really challenging, since it was so difficult to create a loadbearing glass façade while at the same time making a very light structure that uses only a limited amount of bearing points on top of the roof of the existing structure. I really pushed Gilbert to limit these and I remember vividly that he spent an entire holiday calculating a very thin structure. I didn’t know if it would be possible but simply had a hunch. I think many structural engineers would’ve quit at some point, but Gilbert really persisted and made a beautifully light and nimble structure that’s really amazing!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>\u003cstrong>What do you most appreciate about each other?\u003c/strong>\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Nanne:\u003c/strong> Gilbert is audacious, precise and a realist. He is great to work with as he’s service minded, precise in everything he does, and thinks about practicalities while also ensuring that the design stays at a high level. Since he’s also trained as an architect, next to a degree in structural engineering, he knows what counts in terms of design. And last but not least – he’s a buddy!\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Gilbert:\u003c/strong> I love working with Nanne because of his endless enthusiasm. He’s a dreamer with a (sometimes dormant) sense of realism, who is never scared to think (too) big. He’s also very sharing and caring – he’s always trying to let everyone improve themselves and he acts as a coach, sometimes in a really obvious way, but most of the time in a completely natural manner. He has propelled me forward as a person and as a professional. He’s a real friend. I value his opinions and coaching. It’s all about making the cool stuff.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cem>\u003cstrong>What’s the project you dream of making together?\u003c/strong>\u003c/em>\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>\u003cstrong>Gilbert:\u003c/strong> We always said we wanted to build two things together: a skyscraper, and a football stadium. The skyscraper – the Baan Tower – is on the way, so let’s build that stadium!\u003cbr />\n\u003cstrong>Nanne:\u003c/strong> That would be great – even though we support rival teams – Gilbert is an Ajax fan and I’m Feyenoord. I’m pretty sure we would create something epic!\u003c/p>\n"}],"story_author":{"type":"External","team_member":{"ID":492,"post_author":"3","post_date":"2019-07-01 10:21:35","post_date_gmt":"2019-07-01 10:21:35","post_content":"","post_title":"Paul Stavert","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"paul-stavert","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2024-10-03 15:42:22","post_modified_gmt":"2024-10-03 15:42:22","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http://admin.powerhouse.buildin.amsterdam/?post_type=team&#038;p=492","menu_order":1,"post_type":"team","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"name":"Nanne de Ru and Gilbert van der Lee"},"belongs_to_case":[{"ID":2894,"post_author":"3","post_date":"2020-09-11 11:48:10","post_date_gmt":"2020-09-11 11:48:10","post_content":"","post_title":"Behind the Scenes","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"draft","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"behind-the-scenes","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2020-09-11 11:49:20","post_modified_gmt":"2020-09-11 11:49:20","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/?post_type=cases&#038;p=2894","menu_order":75,"post_type":"cases","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"}]},"next_post":{"id":960,"date":"2019-09-25T12:08:26","date_gmt":"2019-09-25T12:08:26","guid":{"rendered":"http://admin.powerhouse.buildin.amsterdam/?post_type=stories&#038;p=960"},"modified":"2020-09-11T11:31:54","modified_gmt":"2020-09-11T11:31:54","slug":"retaining-the-essence","status":"publish","type":"stories","link":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/story/retaining-the-essence/","title":{"rendered":"Retaining the Essence"},"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","case_type":[],"yoast_head":"\u003c!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.9 -

It also featured as the location of a commercial for the Fiat Punto.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>By 2010, however, interior renovation had become imperative. The building had started life as a tailor-made design for Nedlloyd. When Maersk bought Nedlloyd in 2005, and Willemswerf lost its status as a company headquarters, the building was rented out to dozens of other companies in various fields. So the function of the building changed from a corporate HQ with a single occupant to a multi-tenant building, with all the different demands that this entails.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In 2000, real-estate company ASR Vastgoed Vermogensbeheer obtained Willemswerf from the Koninklijke Nedlloyd Groep, and we were later asked us to renovate the first two floors, creating a new concept for the lobby. After over 25 years of use, some areas had become outdated. The office floors, bathrooms, lifts and even the spatially beautiful lobby no longer had the quality of a high-end office building. A collection of not very distinctive objects, such as scale models of ships and various art pieces, obscured the spatial expression of these areas. Because of this deterioration, a significant amount of office space was no longer rented out. So ASR asked us to come up with a concept for restoring quality and tactility to the building. They also wanted us to move the existing canteen, which was originally located on the fifth floor, to the lobby.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Renovating such a landmark comes with a huge responsibility. As we saw it, the challenge was to retain the essence of the building – its spatial quality and adherence to a total concept with full integration of materials, detail and spatial expression. Happily, we were able to include the original architect’s input in this project. In fact, since he still owns all the copyrights of the building, every change had to be approved by him. In order to redesign the lobby, in particular, we had lengthy discussions with Quist, who best knows the concept and character of the building. Together, we formed a plan to preserve, enhance and clarify the geometric grid on which the building is based.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Our concept reactivates the strong spatial identity of the building through a series of tactical interventions. We explored multiple reference projects, including successful hotel and office renovations, to arrive at our solution. In our design, we decided to emulate a fully serviced, high-end hotel environment, in order to attract future tenants. In order to restore the beautiful spatial quality of the Willemswerf, we had to clean up the building to make its clear lines and elegant perspectives visible once more. While making the existing geometric grid our guiding principle, we added warm, luxurious materials to create a more welcoming, tactile atmosphere.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Our makeover is confined to the basement and ground floor yet it sets the tone for the entire building. Our redesigned entrance makes a grand gesture of welcome. We added a sweeping, open spiral staircase to lead visitors from the basement up to the lobby. Above it, we designed a custom spiral light sculpture to heighten the visual impact. Clusters of classic Modernist furniture – sofas, armchairs and coffee tables – give the surrounding meeting space an informal atmosphere. We further added to the quality of the lobby with a luxury coffee bar and restaurant, established around the new central core, where we also located the kitchen, bathrooms and elevators.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>All our interventions transformed a dull, empty – albeit beautiful – space into a lively and atmospheric one. Our new lobby invites workers and their guests and customers to linger in an engaging space for informal meetings and chance encounters – a work environment for the 21st century.\u003c/p>\n"}],"story_author":{"type":"Internal","team_member":{"ID":496,"post_author":"3","post_date":"2019-07-01 10:32:17","post_date_gmt":"2019-07-01 10:32:17","post_content":"","post_title":"Sander Apperlo","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"sander-apperlo","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-11-09 10:40:30","post_modified_gmt":"2022-11-09 10:40:30","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http://admin.powerhouse.buildin.amsterdam/?post_type=team&#038;p=496","menu_order":6,"post_type":"team","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"name":""},"belongs_to_case":[{"ID":116,"post_author":"1","post_date":"2019-03-27 14:09:09","post_date_gmt":"2019-03-27 14:09:09","post_content":"","post_title":"Willemswerf","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"willemswerf","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2024-12-03 15:30:40","post_modified_gmt":"2024-12-03 15:30:40","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http://admin.powerhouse.buildin.amsterdam/?post_type=cases&#038;p=116","menu_order":24,"post_type":"cases","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"2","filter":"raw"}]}}},{"id":960,"date":"2019-09-25T12:08:26","modified":"2020-09-11T11:31:54","slug":"retaining-the-essence","type":"stories","title":{"rendered":"Retaining the Essence"},"yoast_head":"\u003c!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.9 -

All our projects are one-offs, yet the customization of Villa B goes beyond anything we have ever done before. In this case, precision engineering and careful crafting resulted in a unique building that fits its clients as beautifully as a bespoke suit.\u003c/p>\n","content":[{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"\u003cp>Our clients for Villa B are connoisseurs. They accept only the best. For their modern mansion in an upmarket residential area in Munich, they had the highest ambitions. Together with them, we decided to step out of our comfort zone, adding to the uniqueness of the project by allowing only extremely limited tolerances in both the exterior and interior design.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>We based our concept for the villa – which stands on a large, beautiful plot close to the River Isar –on local, classical precedents. With a closed façade at the front, the building has a contrasting open, transparent structure at the back. The materials palette is luxurious and natural, featuring stone, wood, metal and glass.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Giving the varied and unforgiving materials, the level of precision we were aiming at was highly ambitious. Zero tolerance in a construction-site project is almost impossible to achieve. Regulations and building laws are not set up for it, because it makes projects more difficult and expensive. Construction companies don’t want to guarantee it, as buildings move and expand during building – with temperature and humidity playing a big role.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Not surprisingly, it was a constant struggle for us to achieve such exactness with the engineers and local construction team. We had to schedule talks with façade builders, metal workers and interior outfitters on a daily basis. We repeatedly measured the building as it progressed to see where tolerances were in play and where we had to shave down or even reconstruct parts to match our targets. It was a huge amount of extra work – but now we can use the skills we learned on other projects.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>In Villa B, customization is at the heart of both the interior and exterior. It makes the whole house a totally one-off object, a Gesamtkunstwerk – from the swimming pool to the sauna, cinema, bowling alley, sports bar, wine cellar, parking garage, breakfast kitchen and the kids’ bedrooms.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>One of our biggest challenges was the marble façade. Because marble plates of this size can’t be used structurally, nor suspended from a façade system, we had to glue them to 6-cm-thick granite plates. Since the plates are so heavy, a stone specialist wrote a special software program to calculate the stability and construction details of every single plate.\u003c/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"media","type":"inline","media":{"media_type":"image","media_ratio":"150","ratio":[],"video":"","allow_fullscreen_video":false,"fullscreen_video":"","image":{"ID":1461,"id":1461,"title":"Powerhouse-Company-Villa-B-03","filename":"Powerhouse-Company-Villa-B-03.jpg","filesize":417985,"url":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/01125955/Powerhouse-Company-Villa-B-03.jpg","link":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/case/villa-b/powerhouse-company-villa-b-03/","alt":"","author":"3","description":"","caption":"","name":"powerhouse-company-villa-b-03","status":"inherit","uploaded_to":1457,"date":"2019-11-01 12:59:54","modified":"2019-11-01 12:59:54","menu_order":0,"mime_type":"image/jpeg","type":"image","subtype":"jpeg","icon":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/wp-includes/images/media/default.png","width":2205,"height":2754,"sizes":{"thumbnail":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/01125955/Powerhouse-Company-Villa-B-03-150x150.jpg","thumbnail-width":150,"thumbnail-height":150,"medium":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/01125955/Powerhouse-Company-Villa-B-03-240x300.jpg","medium-width":240,"medium-height":300,"medium_large":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/01125955/Powerhouse-Company-Villa-B-03-768x959.jpg","medium_large-width":768,"medium_large-height":959,"large":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/01125955/Powerhouse-Company-Villa-B-03-820x1024.jpg","large-width":820,"large-height":1024,"1536x1536":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/01125955/Powerhouse-Company-Villa-B-03.jpg","1536x1536-width":1230,"1536x1536-height":1536,"2048x2048":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/01125955/Powerhouse-Company-Villa-B-03.jpg","2048x2048-width":1640,"2048x2048-height":2048,"xlarge":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/01125955/Powerhouse-Company-Villa-B-03-1121x1400.jpg","xlarge-width":1121,"xlarge-height":1400}},"caption":""}},{"acf_fc_layout":"text","text":"\u003cp>Integrated, motorized marble shutters are a key element in the façade. These consist of four massive stone panels. Each one measures 2.60m by 1.10m and weighs 1.5 tons. Somehow we had to make these rotate and move to the side, revealing the front window. We needed to consult metalworkers, stone workers, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers and software programmers in order to realize them.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Inside, we executed a design by interior designers Studio Liaigre. The spiral staircase at the heart of the house – a work of art, as well as a feat of engineering – had to be made from fire-retardant materials and clad in wood. We ended up making it by hand onsite, then disassembling it and remaking it in a factory using the correct fireproof materials.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>Within the house, all the technology is hidden behind the ceilings, or barely visible as minimalist metal boxes. The home automation system needed to be operated via touch panels and separate iPads positioned throughout the house, and together with our home-automation specialist we even developed a custom interface for all the operation screens in the house.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>This project was the start of Powerhouse Company‘s Munich office. We now have projects in Paris, Switzerland and Austria, and in Asia we are realizing interiors designed by Studio Liaigre, with whom we developed an excellent working relationship. Leveraging the skills we’ve acquired working with Studio Liaigre, we are also developing a new interior outfitting brand. On a personal level, I even met my wife on the construction site! All together a lot of good things came out of Villa B.\u003c/p>\n\u003cp>At Powerhouse Company, we’re proud that we were able to manage this demanding and complex project so as to achieve such an incredible result. Meeting our clients’ sky-high expectations was challenging at times, but we relished the opportunity to take the villa to the next level. The quality of the execution and the level of detailing is amazing. For us, Villa B is quite simply a modern masterpiece that sets the standard in so many ways.\u003c/p>\n"},{"acf_fc_layout":"media","type":"inline","media":{"media_type":"video","media_ratio":"100","ratio":"landscape","video":"","allow_fullscreen_video":true,"fullscreen_video":"https://static.powerhouse-company.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/03155414/00-Full-MED-bitrate-480p30-4x.mp4","image":false,"caption":""}}],"story_author":{"type":"Internal","team_member":{"ID":496,"post_author":"3","post_date":"2019-07-01 10:32:17","post_date_gmt":"2019-07-01 10:32:17","post_content":"","post_title":"Sander Apperlo","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"sander-apperlo","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2022-11-09 10:40:30","post_modified_gmt":"2022-11-09 10:40:30","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http://admin.powerhouse.buildin.amsterdam/?post_type=team&#038;p=496","menu_order":6,"post_type":"team","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","filter":"raw"},"name":""},"belongs_to_case":[{"ID":1457,"post_author":"3","post_date":"2019-11-01 12:56:02","post_date_gmt":"2019-11-01 12:56:02","post_content":"","post_title":"Villa B","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"villa-b","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2024-03-14 15:44:22","post_modified_gmt":"2024-03-14 15:44:22","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http://admin.powerhouse.buildin.amsterdam/?post_type=cases&#038;p=1457","menu_order":6,"post_type":"cases","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"17","filter":"raw"}]}}}]},"employeesData":{"employees":[]},"materialsData":{"materials":[{"id":3588,"date":"2021-08-19T09:43:22","modified":"2021-08-19T09:43:22","slug":"jura-limestone","type":"materials","title":{"rendered":"Jura Limestone"},"yoast_head":"\u003c!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.9 -

We chose CLT for the floating office as it combines high strength with structural simplicity – ideal for our demountable, recyclable architecture. CLT has a lighter environmental footprint than concrete or steel: using it in this building saved over 1600 tonnes of CO2. Meanwhile, the amount of wood used can be regrown in German forests in just 440 seconds. Naturally, we also appreciate the beauty that it shares with all forms of wood.","author":{"author":false,"author_custom":"","type":"default"}}],"used_in":[{"ID":2309,"post_author":"3","post_date":"2020-01-29 16:31:22","post_date_gmt":"2020-01-29 16:31:22","post_content":"","post_title":"Floating Office Rotterdam (FOR)","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"floating-office-rotterdam","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2025-02-04 09:52:20","post_modified_gmt":"2025-02-04 09:52:20","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http://admin.powerhouse-company.com/?post_type=cases&#038;p=2309","menu_order":5,"post_type":"cases","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"45","filter":"raw"},{"ID":2027,"post_author":"3","post_date":"2019-12-13 09:44:03","post_date_gmt":"2019-12-13 09:44:03","post_content":"","post_title":"Marga Klompé Building","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"marga-klompe-building","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2025-02-25 09:47:32","post_modified_gmt":"2025-02-25 09:47:32","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":0,"guid":"http://admin.powerhouse.buildin.amsterdam/?post_type=cases&#038;p=2027","menu_order":4,"post_type":"cases","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"4","filter":"raw"}]}},{"id":2470,"date":"2020-04-01T19:08:03","modified":"2020-04-01T20:03:41","slug":"2470","type":"materials","title":{"rendered":"Dragon-Skin Aluminium"},"yoast_head":"\u003c!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v18.9 -
